Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.
phase2_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase3_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase4_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
phase5_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: The simulation should be terminated as soon as quit() is called, since we are not in kernel mode.
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
SIMULATOR TRAP: USLOSS_IntVec[USLOSS_ILLEGAL_INT] is NULL!
