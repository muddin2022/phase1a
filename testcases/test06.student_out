Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.
phase2_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP

phase5_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Create XXp1 (moderate priority); that creates 2 XXp2 children (low priority).  XXp1 will block on join(), which will cause main() to wake up and report the spork() results - after which the XXp2 processes will run.
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing spork of first child
XXp1(): spork of first child returned pid = 4
XXp1(): executing spork of second child
XXp1(): spork of second child returned pid = 5
XXp1(): performing first join
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to testcase_main(), since XXp1 has created its two children, which are lower priority than
