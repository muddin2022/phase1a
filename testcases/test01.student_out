Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.

Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: XXp1 should run promptly, as it is high priority; XXp2 should run only *after* we have started the second join(), because it is low priority.
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the first XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
