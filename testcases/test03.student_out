Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: main() creates many XXp1 children, and join()s all of them; then repeats twice.  Process count is large enough to fill process table - meaning that students must free old process table entries.

*** Start of round 0 of the spork()/join() operations ***
